## Installation

```bash
yarn add diox
```


## Motivations

This framework is a mix between Redux and Vuex. Both of them have some drawbacks which makes
development of large-scale applications more and more complex over time. diox brings significant
improvements:

- 100% standalone (no dependency)
- Extremely light (~300 lines of code, 1.5Kb gzipped)
- Fast and optimized by design
- Scalable out of the box without using any additional NPM module, thanks to the concept of Modules
- Native compatibility with any front-end library such as React or VueJS
- Easy to use, with a very small learning curve and simple concepts
- Based on the Observer Design Pattern, which means you can subscribe to state changes, (not possible in Vuex for instance)
